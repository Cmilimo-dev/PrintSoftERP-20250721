# Purchase Module Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Purchase module has been successfully implemented following the MVVM architecture pattern with comprehensive UI components using Jetpack Compose. The module provides complete functionality for managing purchase orders, vendors, purchase receipts, and purchase invoices.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Layer
- **PurchaseModels.kt**: Complete data models for Vendor, PurchaseOrder, PurchaseOrderItem, PurchaseReceipt, PurchaseReceiptItem, and PurchaseInvoice entities
- **PurchaseDao.kt**: Comprehensive DAO interfaces providing CRUD operations for all purchase-related entities
- **PurchaseRepository.kt**: Repository implementation handling both API calls and local database access with offline-first support

### 2. Business Logic Layer
- **PurchaseViewModel.kt**: ViewModel implementing business logic and state management using Kotlin flows and coroutines
- Supports create, update, delete, approve, search, filter, and refresh operations
- Handles loading and error states
- Provides transactional workflows for converting purchase orders to receipts and invoices

### 3. UI Components

#### Main Screens
- **PurchaseScreen.kt**: Main screen with tabbed interface for managing all purchase entities
- **PurchaseDetailScreen.kt**: Detailed view for individual purchase orders with workflow actions

#### Forms
- **PurchaseOrderForm.kt**: Create/edit purchase orders
- **VendorForm.kt**: Create/edit vendors with comprehensive fields
- **PurchaseReceiptForm.kt**: Create/edit purchase receipts
- **PurchaseInvoiceForm.kt**: Create/edit purchase invoices

#### UI Features
- Tab-based navigation (Purchase Orders, Vendors, Receipts, Invoices)
- Dialog-based forms with proper state management
- Card-based list views with relevant information display
- Action buttons for workflow operations (approve, create receipt/invoice)
- Loading states and error handling
- Floating Action Buttons for creating new entities

### 4. Navigation Integration
- Integrated into main navigation system
- Added "Purchase" tab to bottom navigation
- Proper back navigation support
- Dialog management for forms

## Key Features

2. **Receipt creation** from approved purchase orders
3. **Invoice creation** from purchase orders or receipts
4. **Payment status tracking** for invoices
5. **Approval workflows** with proper status management

### Data Management
1. **Offline-first architecture** with local database caching
2. **API synchronization** for real-time data updates
3. **Search and filtering** capabilities
4. **CRUD operations** for all entities
5. **Data validation** and error handling

### User Experience
1. **Material Design 3** components
2. **Consistent UI patterns** following app conventions
3. **Responsive layouts** with proper spacing and typography
4. **Loading and error states** with user feedback
5. **Form validation** and user input handling
