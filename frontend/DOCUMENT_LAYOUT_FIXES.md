# Document Layout Fixes Applied

## Issue Description
The user reported seeing corrupted document layouts with:
- Duplicated headers showing both old and new company information
- Mixed QR codes appearing on documents
- Inconsistent styling between different document generation paths

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by multiple document generation engines running simultaneously:
1. **Comprehensive Document Engine** - Had hardcoded company name "EnerTek Solar Services"
2. **Unified Document Export Service** - Using system settings dynamically
3. **Legacy print components** - Still using old hardcoded values

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Hardcoded Company Name in Comprehensive Document Engine
**File**: `/src/services/comprehensiveDocumentEngine.ts`
**Line**: 1526
**Change**: 
```typescript
// Before:
• Goods belong to EnerTek Solar until completion of payments

// After:
• Goods belong to the company until completion of payments
```

### 2. Updated Print Components to Use Unified Services
**Files Updated**:
- `BusinessDocumentPrint.tsx` - Updated to use `BusinessDocumentService.generatePreviewHTML()`
- `PurchaseOrderPrint.tsx` - Replaced legacy print components with unified service calls
- `BusinessDocumentForm.tsx` - Updated save/export to use unified services

### 3. Ensured Consistent Company Information Source
**Key Changes**:
- All document generation now uses `DocumentCompanyService.getCompanyInfoForDocuments()`
- This service reads from system settings dynamically
- No hardcoded company names in payment terms or headers

### 4. Fixed QR Code Generation
**Issue**: Multiple QR codes were being generated by different engines
**Fix**: Centralized QR code generation in `UnifiedDocumentExportService`
- Only generates QR codes for invoices (E-TIMS compliance)
- Consistent positioning and sizing across all formats

### 5. Updated Document Templates
**Changes**:
- Unified CSS styling across all document types
- Consistent header structure and company information display
- Responsive design for different export formats (PDF, HTML, Print)

## Key Services Involved

### DocumentCompanyService
- Provides centralized company information
- Reads from system settings (`SystemSettingsService`)
- Fallback to default values if settings unavailable

### UnifiedDocumentExportService
- Main export service for all document types
- Handles multiple formats (PDF, HTML, Print, Word, MHT)
- Consistent styling and layout across formats

### BusinessDocumentService
- Orchestrates document creation and management
- Uses unified services for generation and export
- Maintains document workflow and storage

## Expected Results
After these fixes:
1. **No more duplicated headers** - Only one header per document
2. **Consistent company information** - All documents use system settings
3. **Single QR code per document** - Only on invoices, properly positioned
4. **Unified styling** - Professional appearance across all formats
5. **Dynamic company data** - Updates automatically when system settings change

## Testing Recommendations
1. Generate documents of different types (Invoice, Quote, Sales Order, etc.)
2. Test different export formats (PDF, HTML, Print)
3. Update company information in system settings and verify documents reflect changes
4. Check print preview and actual printing output
5. Verify QR codes only appear on invoices and are properly positioned

## Future Considerations
- Consider migrating remaining legacy print components to unified services
- Add template customization options for different document layouts
- Implement document branding settings for logo positioning and styling
- Add validation for company information completeness
